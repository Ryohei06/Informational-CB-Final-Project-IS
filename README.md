This Streamlit application creates a basic informational chatbot. The chatbot leverages OpenAI's API to answer your questions in a comprehensive way. The app will open in your web browser as "Informational Chatbot". Simply type your question and click "Get Information" to receive an informative answer! The code utilizes asynchronous functions and Streamlit features to manage user interaction and display the response. While the current version focuses on individual queries, future enhancements could involve error handling and maintaining conversation context for a more natural experience.
